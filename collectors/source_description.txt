External Sources:
1. Earthquakes: from the web of Centro Sismol√≥gico Nacional (https://sismologia.cl) the information of the last
earthquake (UTC Date, Latitude, Longitude, Depth and Magnitude) produced in Chilean territory. Intended update frequency:
every minute. Intended update moment: at the beginning of each minute (0" second mark). Repeat until new available value: yes.
Local hashing: yes. Default URL for access: http://sismologia.cl/events/listados/<YYYY>/<MM>/<YYYY><MM><DD>.html (where
<YYYY>, <MM>, and <DD>, is the year, month and day of the pulse where the event will be used), then need to check the last
earthquake produced BEFORE the date of the pulse. Recommended sampling trials: immediately perform successive sampling.
Fallback options: None.
2. Radio: from the web of Radio Universidad de Chile (https://radio.uchile.cl) the byte-stream referring to the online
signal of the radio station. Intended update frequency: every minute. Intended update moment: at the beginning of each
minute (0" second mark) will recollect 99840 bytes of the stream (approx. 5 seconds). Repeat until new available value: yes.
Local hashing: yes. Default URL for access: http://200.89.71.21:8000/; (online stream of the radio station). Recommended
sampling trials: immediately perform successive sampling. Fallback options: None.

All the hashed values obtained, in parallel, from the 4 sources described before will be concatenated and be used as
input of a VDF (Verifiable Delay Function) <NEED TO SPECIFY WHICH FUNCTION AND PARAMETERS> whose output will be the
external value used in the pulse generated in the current minute.
