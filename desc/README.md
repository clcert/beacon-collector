# Adding Source Description
The document used as `ext.TextSrcDesc` whose hash will be `ext.srcId`, corresponds to the ReadMe of this repository. That document is parsed into plaintext removing Markdown decorators such as `*` and `#`.

The credentials used to add that field into database are the ones located in `db/dbConfig.json`.
